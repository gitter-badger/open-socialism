# The Media

There is much less need for the media as it does in DC to exist. In DC with segments of self interest there is a lot of incentive to conceal or misrepresent facts.

In OS all areas of society are firstly completely transparent already and also have no incentive to conceal or misrepresent. For example a fault being concealed to ensure sales of a certain item is a common story in a DC society, however in OS there is no incentive to sell a product with a fault since there is no profit being made in the first place.

Individuals may wish to conceal their own mistakes but that is a problem of individual circles/projects to solve so that there is not a great incentive to do this or it isn't possible. Self reporting is also a function of a circle/project so the media is not so important.

People can also opt into only the news sources that they care about rather than a TV show that covers a broad range of content.
An argument can be made for a media section of society which provides a high level overview of events but may not prove to be necessary.
