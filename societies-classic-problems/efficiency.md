# Efficiency

To what degree does people acting in self interest lead to the betterment of society. This should never be 100% as that may be sacrificing individual desires for society too much.

Efficiency tends to be poor either by

* wastage due to competition
* [rent seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) behavior
* wealth being used wastefully and selfishly by the powerful

Poor efficiency is a classical problem.
