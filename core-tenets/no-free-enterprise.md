# No Free Enterprise

There is little question that no free enterprise is better at a theoretical level. Societies with no free enterprise (such as communism) have almost always failed due to corruption becoming rife. These failures are not due to no free enterprise per se but a lack of guards against corruption. Open Socialism (OS) deals with the classic problems of communism in different ways which is dealt with in other sections.

* There is no wastage due to competition between similar entities (companies).

  This includes:
  * marketing
  * advertising
  * duplication of effort of developing the same technology in isolation
  * duplication of effort of administrative efforts such as payroll
  * legal related defense and offense

* Consumer benefit is not the end goal of enterprises.
  * Facts are withheld from consumers to manipulate them into buying.
  * Products and services attempt to manipulate people in a subtly damaging way such as stimulating insecurities.

* Free enterprise tends towards major wealth inequality and a class based society. On paper at an extremely theoretical level free enterprise does not result in major wealth inequality. Those that earn more money pay more tax and the [money trickles down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics). Also as the size of the economy increases existing wealth which naturally accumulates is less significant than new wealth and a relative balance is maintained.

  This at least has never occurred in the past because even a relatively small degree of wealth centralization results in political influence which can make changes that favor the wealthy. Also the economy cannot perpetually grow and during such times existing private wealth accumulates whilst salaries stagnate.

  It may be possible to stem wealth inequality due to free enterprise more so than has occurred in the past but it is difficult at best since it doesn't take much accumulation for the rich to have inordinate political influence and it will snowball from there.

  Major wealth inequality creates a class based unequal society with different levels of service for basic needs such as health. It also [promotes unhappiness for those not in the upper wealth brackets](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/income-disparity-makes-people-unhappy.html).

It's also worth noting the 'no free enterprise' is still a knob and it's possible that 0 is not right setting. This needs to be assessed further, particularly with experiments, once an OS society is running.
