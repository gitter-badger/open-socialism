# Continual Improvement

[Improve everything, all the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process). This needs to be baked into the culture of the work. There may need to be incentives involved which is fine.
Note that continual improvement involves continual experimentation which sometimes will make things (temporarily) worse. However, this teaches us something and contributes towards a general upward trend of improvement.
