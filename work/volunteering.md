# Volunteering

There would be much less of a need for volunteering as a lot of volunteering is to help stem DCs inability to provide all the required services. For example keeping the streets free from litter should be doable without any need for volunteering.

However, there is still the scenario where a person works in one area but really wants to help in a different area in their spare time. Departments that people may want to do this for should be enabling it. There could also be status and or monetary rewards for this too.
