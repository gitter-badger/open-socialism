# Drug usage

All drugs will be legal within OC. Prohibition creates more problems than it solves.

However:

* Extensive research will be performed on currently illicit drugs to give very clear indication of their dangers and methods of safe usage. Currently this is avoided largely because illegal drugs are supposed to have no safe methods of usage which is not true at least for all illicit drugs.
* Superb rehab + education would be set up around drugs to help people avoid drug abuse/dependence.
