# Policing

Policing would not be especially different but the requirement for it should lesson over time as factors which promote crime like differing social classes dissipating.

Police should also be more in the vein of civic helpers. Whilst they have guidelines on how to act they are empowered to use their own judgement and make decisions on right and wrong. For that reason they need much greater moral training and level headedness to make ethical decisions under tense situations. If they can't that's ok as disputes can go to court.
