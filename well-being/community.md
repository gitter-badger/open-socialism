# Community

People will be a part of multiple communities and technology and practices need to reinforce these communities. They are as follows:

* Family
* Friends
* Local community
* Workplace division/workmates
* Profession/Interests

Interacting with all these groups can be difficult which is why technology is important. Similar to facebook groups technology can be used to allow an individual to stay up to date and contribute to the groups that they belong. This is very important for such a society since it allows people to be stimulated and satisfied in many different groups.

However the most important group is an individuals 'tribe' which the immediate family and those that live close by. Humans are tribal and we can only truly be in a tribe with those that we live around and see face to face. Systems need to be in place to have people automatically coming together as local communities and helping each other out. This is how we have evolved to function.
