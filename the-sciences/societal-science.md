# Societal Science

Societal science is the science that underlies how all parts of society operate in OS. In particular it is how [circles](../hierarchy/circles.md) and [projects](../hierarchy/projects.md) operate and how they can be adjusted for different effects.

Improving this science can improve all areas of society so it is the most important.
