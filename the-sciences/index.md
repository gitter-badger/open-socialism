# The Sciences

The sciences are a key part of OS. Unlike DC a large portion of society will be focused on pure science or technology work to be used by the rest of society.

The list of sciences looks like the following:

1. Societal Science
2. Core Sciences
3. Secondary Sciences
4. Core Technology
5. Secondary Technology

The higher up the list the more important to society (on average) that science is and much effect advancing that science can have.
