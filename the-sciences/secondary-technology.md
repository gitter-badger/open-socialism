# Secondary Technology

Secondary technology are the products and technologies used by the end consumers which can be departments or individuals for personal usage. A TV is an example of a secondary technology. Another would be a project management application.

In some cases it may make sense for even more hierarchy such as specific foundational technology teams that service particular industries, but themselves still depend on core technology.
