# Field Education

Field education would be free and anyone can join any course they want at any age. Courses would be tweaked to become self learning centric with clear course materials that students can follow along with a minimum amount of help.

For entrance into the full course students would need to self study and pass an entrance test. Beyond this there would be no restrictions.

However, like the real world if everyone completes a graphic design course they may not be able to get a job as a graphic designer if there are a limited number of jobs.

Another alternative would be to make each course difficult enough so that the amount of people that can pass it matches the number of jobs in that field.
