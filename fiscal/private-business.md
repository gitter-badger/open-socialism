# Private Business

Private business is not allowed under OS as that would allow unrestricted wealth accumulation. In all likelihood there is no need for anything resembling it either such as entrepreneurship or startups.

What replaces startups?

The means and the reward for supplying new ideas.

Any circle or project at any level needs to have mechanisms in place to receive feedback. This feedback should be able to be up-voted by other people and the best ideas will rise to the top. There should be some kind of reward for good ideas that help society. This reward could be purely status based or it could also include remuneration.

Another option is to allow startups and give them the resources they need. At certain point they would be deemed successful or failures and if successful they would be rolled into existing society. Those that created the startup would receive status and reward.
