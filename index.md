## The Open Socialism System

Open Socialism (OS) is a societal system that is designed to be the highly equitable, productive and favor long term thinking. It combines ideas from socialism, communism, capitalism, [the open source software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement), [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology).

OS core goal is long term human survival. Achieving this involves things like sustainable living, advancement of technology and colonization of other planets.

OS secondary goals are making corruption and power centralization as difficult as possible, keeping a relatively even distribution of wealth whilst rewarding individual effort, a happy and engaged populace and maximizing productivity and efficiency.  

OS is based upon modern technology. Not just technology that is currently in existence but technology that is feasible to create.

OS is non-dogmatic and it's core principle is continual improvement and adaption. Every part of OS is up for change and challenging its ideas is highly encouraged and actually baked into the system itself. What's more, different areas of societies can use different systems as it makes sense to do so.

Like any system OS also must have mechanisms to persist itself. The difference is that other systems have been persisted to maintain the domination structure of society that benefits the ruling class. OS is designed to truly remove class differences but still attempts persist itself because it should be better than any alternative system. Even if it is OS actively absorbs any new ideas into it so in theory a clean break to a completely different system would not be needed for the foreseeable future.
